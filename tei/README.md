# TEI Manuscript Descriptions and Transcriptions

This directory contains
- TEI-XML files of individual manuscripts ([OxfordLaudOr258.xml](OxfordLaudOr258.xml) and [SinaiAr2.xml](SinaiAr2.xml)), which include a manuscript description, and a manually corrected transcription sample, for which each line is linked to the corresponding region on the manuscript image. This shows what manuscript-level TEI files look like **after cataloguing in ManuForma and transcription in eScriptorium**. Some elements and attributes are left blank to show fields that can be filled in ManuForma.
- A TEI-XML file showing a transcription to which **verse numbers** have been added for the sake of alignment ([SinaiAr2-versified.xml](SinaiAr2-versified.xml)).
- A small edition ([Gen1_1-10.xml](Gen1_1-10.xml)) showing a passage collated in LERA, which can be displayed with the text-critical apparatus in TEI Publisher.
