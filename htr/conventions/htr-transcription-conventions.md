# HTR Transcription Conventions

1. _Only_ transcribe the lines that are Bible text, not headings, rubrics, marginalia, catchwords, etc.
2. Everything should be typed _exactly_ as it appears in the manuscript. 
3. Don't add any dots to the _rasm_ that aren't in the manuscript. 
    1. E.g., if you see فال instead of قال or حعل instead of جعل, don't correct it. 
    3. Pay attention to ي vs. ى and ة vs. ه. Many manuscripts do not place dots above a _ta marbuta_.
    4. For undotted _initial/medial_ ب، ت، ث، ن، ي use the undotted ى (which you can get by pressing the shift key).
    5. For undotted _final_ ب، ت، or ث use the ٮ (you can copy it from here).
    6. Final ن is always ن even if it is undotted in the manuscript.
    7. For an undotted _initial/medial_ ف/ق, which cannot be distinguished from each other, use ٯ ("dotless qaf" not _waw_, copy it from here). 
4. Do _not_ transcribe any vowels at all, even if the manuscript has them.
5. Do _not_ transcribe any _hamza_ diacritics (e.g. أ) or _shadda_ even if the manuscript has them. 
    1. Except: Allah can be written as الله even if the manuscript doesn't have the diacritics.
7. Pay careful attention not to add ء (_hamza_) as a consonant unless it is in the manuscript. Do not standardize spellings.
10. Transcribe all dividers (dots, circles, crosses, etc.) with a simple period with spaces on each side ( . )
